Hey There! My name is Siphr. I'm a 15 Year Old Web and Discord Tools Developer from Mexico City, Mexico and currently reside in Tulum, Mexico. I'm currently working on a project named **Novus** this will be a chat application based off of [Omegle](https://omegle.com), but with many more features such as accounts, user badges, and much more!
